	<h1>About us!</h1>
<p>Our mission is to foster, end animal suffering, and help find these beautiful animals their forever home. We are committed to 100 percent placement of adoptable animals and envision a time when every friendly, healthy, homeless animal in our community can be cared for until a new family is found. We provide the best shelter to homeless animals that are left by their guardians, animals that are rescued from abuse or neglect, and stray or abandoned cats. You are more then welcome to stop in and visit these adorable animals we help and have available for adoption. This is where happily ever after begins-for both shelter pets and people.</p>
	<h1>Core Values</h1>
<h2>Compassion</h2>

<p>We treat animals and people with respect, empathy, and kindness. We listen and respond to the needs of people who surrender animals to us, adopt from us, report abuse to us, use our services, support us, work for us, volunteer for us, and to other animal welfare organizations that turn to us for help. We believe every life we touch should be treated with dignity.</p>
	
<h2>Commitment</h2>

<p>We believe that every life has value and worth. We are determined to maintain an environment of transparency, responsibility, and high ethical and professional standards in working to fulfill every aspect of our mission.</p>

<h2>Advocacy</h2>

<p>We are committed to being the voice of animals. We believe that collaboration, education, and participation in influencing positive change on behalf of animals are the cornerstones of elevating their place in society and promoting the value of their lives.</p>
